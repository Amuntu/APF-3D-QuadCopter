# APF-3D-QuadCopter
## _by Amin Haydar_

### Description
This is a Simulation of a Quadcopter in 3D-space, applying APF _(Artificial Potential Field)_ algorithm in order to move the quadcopter from point to point.
I enhanced the basic APF algorithm by refining obstacle detection and using exponential functions for both repulsive and attractive fields, which sped up calculations and improved pathfinding toward the goal.
Additionally, I introduced dynamic obstacles to demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency.
The quadcopter's control system was based on fundamental kinematic principles, utilizing rotation matrices, torque matrices, and inertia force matrices for all rotational movements.

### HOW TO USE CODES
There are Environments ways that you can run the simulation at (MATLAB or CopeliaSim)
Just make sure that you have one of the software to use the Codes.
